waresim
=======

A warehouse simulator.


Build: make

Run: ./waresim.out CONFIG

Two sample config files and their corresponding warehouse layout files are included. warehouse.txt and config.txt correspond to a simple 5x5 warehouse. big__config and big_warehouse.txt correspond to a 92x101 warehouse.

'B' represents a bin, '.' represents an empty location, 'W' represents a worker pod, 'D' represents a drop-off location, and 'X' represents a wall.


Configuration File Parameters
=======
Below is a sample configuration file with all possible parameters specified.

Length:1000

Warehouse:big_warehouse.txt

Seed:1000

Log:logs

View:OpenGL

Dispatch:Rand

Routing:FCFS

---

1. _Length_: The length of the simulation in seconds.
2. _Warehouse_: The location of the warehouse layout file.
3. _Seed_: The master seed for the simulation.
4. _Log_: Directory for the log files.
5. _View_: The simulation view to use. Currently supported values are 'OpenGL' and 'None'.
⋅⋅* OpenGL: A real-time warehouse rendering using OpenGL.
⋅⋅* None: No rendering will be displayed.
6. _Dispatch_: The dispatch algorithm to use. The only supported value is 'Rand'.
⋅⋅* Rand: Orders are randomly assigned to workers.
7. _Routing_: The routing algorithm to use. The only supported value is 'FCFS'
⋅⋅* FCFS: A first-come first served algorithm, where order are processed in the order they were assigned to the worker.
